## LinkedIn Formatting Rules

### Character Limits

| Zone | Limit | Importance |
|------|-------|------------|
| Above fold (desktop) | 210 chars | Only visible before "See more" |
| Above fold (mobile) | 140 chars | Even more critical |
| Total post | 3,000 chars | Maximum allowed |
| Optimal engagement | 1,300-1,600 chars | Best performance |

### Text Formatting

**LinkedIn does NOT support native bold/italic.** Must use Unicode converters.

| Format | How to Create | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Bold | Unicode converter tool | Use for emphasis only |
| Italic | Unicode converter tool | Use sparingly |
| Regular | Type normally | For most content |

**What does NOT work:**
- `**bold**` (Markdown) - shows as plain text
- `*italic*` (Markdown) - shows as plain text
- `# Headers` (Markdown) - shows as plain text
- HTML tags - stripped or shown as text

### Line Breaks

- Line breaks ARE preserved
- Use short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Single blank line between paragraphs
- White space improves readability

### Hashtags

| Rule | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Quantity | 3-5 maximum |
| Placement | End of post |
| Style | #CamelCase for multi-word |
| Integration | Can weave into text naturally |

### Links

**CRITICAL**: LinkedIn algorithm penalizes external links in main post.

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Video/resource links | Put in FIRST COMMENT |
| Main post | Keep link-free for better reach |
| URLs | Always include `https://` |

### Emojis

| Usage | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Quantity | 3-5 per post maximum |
| Type | Functional emojis only |
| Placement | Section markers, emphasis |

**Recommended emojis:**
- Insights, ideas
- Goals, targets
- Completed, confirmed
- Launch, growth
- Data, metrics

- Posts without external links

Optimize for:
- Hook that stops scrolling
